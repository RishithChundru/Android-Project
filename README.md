ðŸ“± # Android Project â€“ Dropout Risk Prediction Tool
A predictive Android application that analyzes the risk of student dropout based on key performance indicators such as grades, attendance, fee payment status, and behavior.

The system helps identify students who may be at risk and supports timely intervention through a dual-dashboard system:

Admin Dashboard: Allows teachers/admins to input and manage student data.

Student Dashboard: Displays performance metrics and alerts students if they are at risk of dropping out.
